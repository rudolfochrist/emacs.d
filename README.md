SSH Agency
-----------

This package provides functions to startup `ssh-agent`, prompt for
passphrases from the Windows console, and set the needed environment
variables in Emacs, so that pushes and pulls from magit will not
require entering any passphrase.

It can also be useful on Unix-like platforms to delay having to enter
your passphrase until the first time you push to a remote.

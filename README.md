## Note

This (`https://github.com/camdez/goto-last-change.el`) is the
canonical repository for the package.  I reached out to Kevin about
getting the project hosted somewhere other than EmacsWiki so we can
get it on MELPA Stable and he sent me the following:

Hi Cameron,

Thanks for the info, I had no idea about such dependencies.  I'm
pleased to hear that it is being used, but at the moment I don't have
a working development machine so I can't handle the Git upload and
tagging.  I'd really appreciate it if you would take care of that and
host goto-last-change.el on MELPA.

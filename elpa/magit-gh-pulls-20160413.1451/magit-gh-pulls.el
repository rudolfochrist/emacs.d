;;; Commentary:

;; This is a Magit extension for manipulating GitHub pull requests

;; No configuration is needed in the repository if any of your remotes contain a
;; URL to Github's remote repository. If for some reason you don't have any
;; Github remotes in your config, you can specify username and repository
;; explicitly:

;; $ git config magit.gh-pulls-repo <user>/<repo> # your github repository

;; Add these lines to your init.el:

;; (require 'magit-gh-pulls)
;; (add-hook 'magit-mode-hook 'turn-on-magit-gh-pulls)

;; These are the bindings for pull requests, defined in magit-gh-pulls-mode-map:
;; # g --- refreshes the list of pull requests
;; # f --- fetches the commits associated with the pull request at point
;; # b --- helps you creating a topic branch from a review request
;; # m --- merges the PR on top of the current branch
;; # c --- creates a PR from the current branch
;; # o --- opens a pull request on GitHub in your default browser

;; Then, you can do whatever you want with the commit objects associated with
;; the pull request (merge, cherry-pick, diff, ...)

;; When you create a new pull request, you can enable -w option to automatically
;; open it on GitHub in your default browser.

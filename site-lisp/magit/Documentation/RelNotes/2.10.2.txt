Magit v2.10.2 Release Notes (unreleased)
========================================

Fixes since v2.10.1
-------------------

* Cherry-picking a commit with multiple parents was not possible,
  because "--mainline" was treated as a switch rather than an option,
  and because of a too-strict assertion that only single-parent commits
  can be cherry-picked.  #2978

* magit-abbrev-length mishandled two edge cases, returning 0 when
  called within an empty repository or outside of a repository.
  077740f5

* A bug fix in the last release broke the visit-file functionality in
  diff buffers displayed while committing.  #2988

;;; zel.el --- Access frecent files easily  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Copyright (C) 2017 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

;; Author: Sebastian Christ <rudolfo.christ@gmail.com>
;; URL: https://github.com/rudolfochrist/zel
;; Version: 0.1.3-pre
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "25") (frecency "0.1"))
;; Keywords: convenience, files, matching

;;; Commentary:

;; zel tracks the most used files, based on 'frecency'.  Zel is
;; basically a port of z[1] in Emacs Lisp.

;; The list of 'frecent' files underlies two concepts:

;; 1. The files are not only ranked on how recent they have been
;; visited, but also how frequent they have been visited.  A file that
;; has been visited multiple times last week gets a higher score as
;; file visited once yesterday.  Outliers should not compromise the
;; 'frecent' list.

;; 2. Entries in the 'frecent' list undergo aging.  If the age of a
;; entry falls under a threshold it gets removed from the 'frecent'
;; list.

;;;; Installation

;;;;; MELPA

;; If you installed from MELPA, you're done.

;;;;; use-package

;; (use-package zel
;;   :ensure t
;;   :demand t
;;   :bind (("C-x C-r" . zel-find-file-frecent))
;;   :config (zel-install))

;;;;; Manual

;; Install these required packages:

;; - frecency

;; Then put this file in your load-path, and put this in your init
;; file:

;; (require 'zel)

;;;; Usage

;; 1. Run (zel-install)
;; 2. Bind `zel-find-file-frecent' to a key,
;;    e.g. (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-r") #'zel-find-file-frecent)
;; 3. Visit some files to build up the database
;; 4. Profit.

;; As default the 'frecent' history is saved to `zel-history-file'.
;; Run 'M-x customize-group RET zel' for more customization options.

;; Besides `zel-find-file-frecent', that lets you select a file with
;; `completing-read' and switches to it, there is also the command
;; `zel-diplay-rankings' that shows all entries of the 'frecent' list
;; along with their score.

;; If you'd like to stop building up the 'frecent' list then run
;; `zel-uninstall' to deregister `zel' from all hooks.

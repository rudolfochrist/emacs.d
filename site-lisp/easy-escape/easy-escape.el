;;; Commentary:

;; `easy-escape-minor-mode' uses syntax highlighting and composition to make ELisp regular
;; expressions more readable.  More precisely, it hides double backslashes
;; preceding regexp specials (`()|'), composes other double backslashes into
;; single ones, and applies a special face to each.  The underlying buffer text
;; is not modified.
;;
;; For example, `easy-escape` prettifies this:
;;   "\\(?:\\_<\\\\newcommand\\_>\\s-*\\)?"
;; into this (`^' indicates a different color):
;;   "(?:\_<\\newcommand\_>\s-*)?".
;;    ^                        ^
;;
;; The default is to use a single \ character instead of two, and to hide
;; backslashes preceding parentheses or `|'.  The escape character and its color
;; can be customized using `easy-escape-face' and `easy-escape-character' (which see), and backslashes
;; before ()| can be shown by disabling `easy-escape-hide-escapes-before-delimiters'.
;;
;; Suggested setup:
;;   (add-hook 'lisp-mode-hook 'easy-escape-minor-mode)
;;
;; NOTE: If you find the distinction between the fontified double-slash and the
;; single slash too subtle, try the following:
;;
;; * Adjust the foreground of `easy-escape-face'
;; * Set `easy-escape-character' to a different character.
